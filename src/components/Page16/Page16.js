                    <p>We work with independent, third-party auditors to evaluate suppliers against more than 500 criteria in a process that lasts anywhere from a day to more than a week, depending on the scale of the supplierâ€™s operations.

                        Taking corrective action If we uncover non-compliance, we take prompt action to ensure suppliers not only correct the issue, but make meaningful, long-term changes. We do this through a Corrective Action Plan (CAP), during which 30-, 60-, and 90- day check-ins with Apple are required.</p>
